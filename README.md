# Online Retail Growth Analytics

A concise end-to-end growth analytics pipeline for an “Online Retail” dataset. This project demonstrates best practices in data cleaning, funnel & cohort analysis, product ranking, seasonality modeling, and dashboarding.

## 📖 Description  
We analyze 541,909 transactions (8 fields) from an e-commerce retailer to answer key growth questions:  
- Data quality & cleaning  
- Sales volume & revenue trends  
- Funnel conversion & cohort retention  
- Product performance (top-selling vs. top-revenue items)  
- Customer behavior (repeat vs. one-time buyers, AOV)  
- Seasonality & rolling trends

## ⚙️ Prerequisites  
- Python 3.7+  
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

## 🚀 Setup & Installation  
1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/online-retail-analytics.git
   cd online-retail-analytics
````

2. Install dependencies (using pip or conda):

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
   ```
3. Place `data.csv` in the project root.

## ▶️ Usage

1. Open `pythonproject.ipynb` in Jupyter or Colab.
2. Run all cells in order.
3. Inspect outputs:

   * Data quality metrics
   * Revenue & funnel charts
   * Product ranking lists
   * Cohort retention heatmap
   * Seasonality plots

## 🧪 Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**:

   * Drop rows missing `CustomerID` or `Description`
   * Exclude non-positive `Quantity` and `UnitPrice` entries
2. **Feature Engineering**:

   * Compute `TotalPrice = Quantity × UnitPrice`
   * Extract `Month`, `Quarter`, `Weekday` from `InvoiceDate`
3. **Analysis**:

   * **Revenue & Volume**: total/net revenue, items sold, monthly trend
   * **Funnel & Cohorts**: stage conversion rates, repeat vs. one-time buyers, AOV
   * **Product Analysis**: top 10 by quantity vs. revenue
   * **Seasonality**: monthly/quarterly trends, 30-day rolling average

## 📊 Key Findings

* **Net revenue:** £8,300,065.81 over the period
* **Activation lift:** Fridays had highest average items/invoice
* **Top products by volume:** “PAPER CRAFT , LITTLE BIRDIE” & “MEDIUM CERAMIC TOP STORAGE JAR”
* **Repeat buyers:** 65.6% (one-timers: 34.4%)
* **Seasonal spikes:** strong Q4 holiday lift

## ⚠️ Limitations

* \~25% missing `CustomerID` biases cohort analysis
* No true “add to cart” or promotional flags
* Bulk orders may mask individual behavior

## 💡 Recommendations

1. Enforce `CustomerID` capture at checkout
2. Instrument cart-abandon events for full funnel visibility
3. Tag promotional campaigns for lift analysis
4. Launch re-engagement campaigns for one-timers
